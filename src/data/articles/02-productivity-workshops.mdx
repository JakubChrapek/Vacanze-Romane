This is a summary of all the inspiring and helpful ideas that I came aross throughout the last years. It is meant to be an articel that I could come back to whenever I feel the need to reflect on my everyday productivity or reevaluate methods and thoughts. Therefor it is a living article that might get changed and extended quite a lot. I published it thinking that it should not only be helping me, but potentially other people as well.
